# This is a simple Python program

# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Ask the user for their age
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Do a simple calculation
next_year_age = age + 1

# Print a result
print(f"Hello, {name}! Next year you will be {next_year_age} years old.")
